# Sugammadex

A modified γ-cyclodextrin with a lipophilic core and a hydrophilic periphery. Rocuranium binds to the lipophilic core and is chelated, unable to bind AChRs at NMJ.

Presentation: 100 mg/ml in either 200mg/2ml or 500mg/5ml

Median recovery time (T4/T1 = 0.9) is approx 2 minutes

## Dose

Block depth | Dose (mg/kg) | Volume (ml/kg) | 2 ml ampoules for 80 kg pt
------------|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------
Moderate (T2-T4) | 2 | 0.02 | 1
Deep (1–2 PTC) | 4 | 0.04 | 2
Immediate | 16 | 0.16 | 7

Dosed according to actual body weight.

## Waiting time for re–administration of steroidal NMB after sugammadex reversal

Suxamethonium and benzylisoquinoliniums (atracurium) can be used at any time following sugammadex reversal i.e. they're unaffected by sugammadex.

The following **only** applies with **routine** reversal doses (i.e. up to 4mg/kg sugammadex).

Minimum waiting time | NMB and dose to be administered
---------------------|--------------------------------
5 minutes | 1.2 mg/kg rocuranium
4 hours | 0.6 mg/kg rocuranium _or_ 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium

!!! info "Rocuranium (1.2 mg/kg) following sugammadex reversal"
    **Onset** of neuromuscular blockade may be up to 4 minutes.

    **Duration** of neuromuscular blockade may be shortened to 15 minutes.

!!! warning
    After immediate reversal with 16 mg/kg sugammadex, a waiting time of 24hrs is recommended.
